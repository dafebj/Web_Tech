      <h2>The Science Behind Time Travel</h2>
      <p>Time travel has long been a fascinating concept in both science fiction and scientific theory. In simple terms, time travel refers to the ability to move forward or backward through time. While we have not yet discovered how to travel through time, some theories suggest that it's possible under certain conditions.</p>
      
      <h3>Theories of Time Travel:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>General Relativity:</strong> Time dilation occurs near massive objects or at high speeds, suggesting that time can be manipulated.</li>
        <li><strong>Wormholes:</strong> Hypothetical tunnels through spacetime that could allow travel between distant points in time.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantum Mechanics:</strong> The idea of parallel universes and quantum entanglement may offer insight into time travel.</li>
      </ul>
